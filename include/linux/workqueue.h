	 * to execute and tries to keep idle cores idle to conserve power;
	 * however, for example, a per-cpu work item scheduled from an
	 * interrupt handler on an idle CPU will force the scheduler to

	 * marked with this flag and enabling the power_efficient mode
	 * leads to noticeable power saving at the cost of small
	 * performance disadvantage.
