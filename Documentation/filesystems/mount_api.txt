========
OVERVIEW
========

The creation of new mounts is now to be done in a multistep process:

 (1) Create a filesystem context.

 (2) Parse the options and attach them to the context.  Options are expected to
     be passed individually from userspace, though legacy binary options can be
     handled.

 (3) Validate and pre-process the context.

 (4) Get or create a superblock and mountable root.

 (5) Perform the mount.

 (6) Return an error message attached to the context.

 (7) Destroy the context.

To support this, the file_system_type struct gains a new field:

	int (*init_fs_context)(struct fs_context *fc, struct dentry *reference);

which is invoked to set up the filesystem-specific parts of a filesystem
context, including the additional space.  The reference parameter is used to
convey a superblock and an automount point or a point to reconfigure from which
the filesystem may draw extra information (such as namespaces) for submount
(FS_CONTEXT_FOR_SUBMOUNT) or reconfiguration (FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE)
purposes - otherwise it will be NULL.

Note that security initialisation is done *after* the filesystem is called so
that the namespaces may be adjusted first.

And the super_operations struct gains one field:

	int (*reconfigure)(struct super_block *, struct fs_context *);

This shadows the ->reconfigure() operation and takes a prepared filesystem
context instead of the mount flags and data page.  It may modify the sb_flags
in the context for the caller to pick up.

[NOTE] reconfigure is intended as a replacement for remount_fs.


======================
THE FILESYSTEM CONTEXT
======================

The creation and reconfiguration of a superblock is governed by a filesystem
context.  This is represented by the fs_context structure:

	struct fs_context {
		const struct fs_context_operations *ops;
		struct file_system_type *fs_type;
		void			*fs_private;
		struct dentry		*root;
		struct user_namespace	*user_ns;
		struct net		*net_ns;
		const struct cred	*cred;
		char			*source;
		char			*subtype;
		void			*security;
		void			*s_fs_info;
		unsigned int		sb_flags;
		enum fs_context_purpose	purpose:8;
		bool			sloppy:1;
		bool			silent:1;
		...
	};

The fs_context fields are as follows:

 (*) const struct fs_context_operations *ops

     These are operations that can be done on a filesystem context (see
     below).  This must be set by the ->init_fs_context() file_system_type
     operation.

 (*) struct file_system_type *fs_type

     A pointer to the file_system_type of the filesystem that is being
     constructed or reconfigured.  This retains a reference on the type owner.

 (*) void *fs_private

     A pointer to the file system's private data.  This is where the filesystem
     will need to store any options it parses.

 (*) struct dentry *root

     A pointer to the root of the mountable tree (and indirectly, the
     superblock thereof).  This is filled in by the ->get_tree() op.  If this
     is set, an active reference on root->d_sb must also be held.

 (*) struct user_namespace *user_ns
 (*) struct net *net_ns

     There are a subset of the namespaces in use by the invoking process.  They
     retain references on each namespace.  The subscribed namespaces may be
     replaced by the filesystem to reflect other sources, such as the parent
     mount superblock on an automount.

 (*) const struct cred *cred

     The mounter's credentials.  This retains a reference on the credentials.

 (*) char *source

     This specifies the source.  It may be a block device (e.g. /dev/sda1) or
     something more exotic, such as the "host:/path" that NFS desires.

 (*) char *subtype

     This is a string to be added to the type displayed in /proc/mounts to
     qualify it (used by FUSE).  This is available for the filesystem to set if
     desired.

 (*) void *security

     A place for the LSMs to hang their security data for the superblock.  The
     relevant security operations are described below.

 (*) void *s_fs_info

     The proposed s_fs_info for a new superblock, set in the superblock by
     sget_fc().  This can be used to distinguish superblocks.

 (*) unsigned int sb_flags

     This holds the SB_* flags to be set in super_block::s_flags.

 (*) enum fs_context_purpose

     This indicates the purpose for which the context is intended.  The
     available values are:

	FS_CONTEXT_FOR_USER_MOUNT,	-- New superblock for user-specified mount
	FS_CONTEXT_FOR_KERNEL_MOUNT,	-- New superblock for kernel-internal mount
	FS_CONTEXT_FOR_SUBMOUNT		-- New automatic submount of extant mount
	FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE	-- Change an existing mount

 (*) bool sloppy
 (*) bool silent

     These are set if the sloppy or silent mount options are given.

     [NOTE] sloppy is probably unnecessary when userspace passes over one
     option at a time since the error can just be ignored if userspace deems it
     to be unimportant.

     [NOTE] silent is probably redundant with sb_flags & SB_SILENT.

The mount context is created by calling vfs_new_fs_context(), vfs_sb_reconfig()
or vfs_dup_fs_context() and is destroyed with put_fs_context().  Note that the
structure is not refcounted.

VFS, security and filesystem mount options are set individually with
vfs_parse_mount_option().  Options provided by the old mount(2) system call as
a page of data can be parsed with generic_parse_monolithic().

When mounting, the filesystem is allowed to take data from any of the pointers
and attach it to the superblock (or whatever), provided it clears the pointer
in the mount context.

The filesystem is also allowed to allocate resources and pin them with the
mount context.  For instance, NFS might pin the appropriate protocol version
module.


=================================
THE FILESYSTEM CONTEXT OPERATIONS
=================================

The filesystem context points to a table of operations:

	struct fs_context_operations {
		void (*free)(struct fs_context *fc);
		int (*dup)(struct fs_context *fc, struct fs_context *src_fc);
		int (*parse_source)(struct fs_context *fc, char *source);
		int (*parse_option)(struct fs_context *fc, char *opt, size_t len);
		int (*parse_monolithic)(struct fs_context *fc, void *data,
					size_t data_size);
		int (*validate)(struct fs_context *fc);
		int (*get_tree)(struct fs_context *fc);
	};

These operations are invoked by the various stages of the mount procedure to
manage the filesystem context.  They are as follows:

 (*) void (*free)(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called to clean up the filesystem-specific part of the filesystem context
     when the context is destroyed.  It should be aware that parts of the
     context may have been removed and NULL'd out by ->get_tree().

 (*) int (*dup)(struct fs_context *fc, struct fs_context *src_fc);

     Called when a filesystem context has been duplicated to duplicate the
     filesystem-private data.  An error may be returned to indicate failure to
     do this.

     [!] Note that even if this fails, put_fs_context() will be called
	 immediately thereafter, so ->dup() *must* make the
	 filesystem-private data safe for ->free().

 (*) int (*parse_source)(struct fs_context *fc, char *source);

     Called when a source or device is specified for a filesystem context.
     This may be called multiple times if the filesystem supports it.  If
     successful, 0 should be returned or a negative error code otherwise.

 (*) int (*parse_option)(struct fs_context *fc, char *opt, size_t len);

     Called when an option is to be added to the filesystem context.  opt
     points to the option string, likely in "key[=val]" format.  VFS-specific
     options will have been weeded out and fc->sb_flags updated in the context.
     Security options will also have been weeded out and fc->security updated.

     If successful, 0 should be returned or a negative error code otherwise.

 (*) int (*parse_monolithic)(struct fs_context *fc,
			     void *data, size_t data_size);

     Called when the mount(2) system call is invoked to pass the entire data
     page in one go.  If this is expected to be just a list of "key[=val]"
     items separated by commas, then this may be set to NULL.

     The return value is as for ->parse_option().

     If the filesystem (e.g. NFS) needs to examine the data first and then
     finds it's the standard key-val list then it may pass it off to
     generic_parse_monolithic().

 (*) int (*validate)(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called when all the options have been applied and the mount is about to
     take place.  It is should check for inconsistencies from mount options and
     it is also allowed to do preliminary resource acquisition.  For instance,
     the core NFS module could load the NFS protocol module here.

     Note that if fc->purpose == FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE, some of the
     options necessary for a new mount may not be set.

     The return value is as for ->parse_option().

 (*) int (*get_tree)(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called to get or create the mountable root and superblock, using the
     information stored in the filesystem context (reconfiguration goes via a
     different vector).  It may detach any resources it desires from the
     filesystem context and transfer them to the superblock it creates.

     On success it should set fc->root to the mountable root and return 0.  In
     the case of an error, it should return a negative error code.

     The phase on a userspace-driven context will be set to only allow this to
     be called once on any particular context.


===========================
FILESYSTEM CONTEXT SECURITY
===========================

The filesystem context contains a security pointer that the LSMs can use for
building up a security context for the superblock to be mounted.  There are a
number of operations used by the new mount code for this purpose:

 (*) int security_fs_context_alloc(struct fs_context *fc,
				   struct dentry *reference);

     Called to initialise fc->security (which is preset to NULL) and allocate
     any resources needed.  It should return 0 on success or a negative error
     code on failure.

     reference will be non-NULL if the context is being created for superblock
     reconfiguration (FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE) in which case it indicates
     the root dentry of the superblock to be reconfigured.  It will also be
     non-NULL in the case of a submount (FS_CONTEXT_FOR_SUBMOUNT) in which case
     it indicates the automount point.

 (*) int security_fs_context_dup(struct fs_context *fc,
				 struct fs_context *src_fc);

     Called to initialise fc->security (which is preset to NULL) and allocate
     any resources needed.  The original filesystem context is pointed to by
     src_fc and may be used for reference.  It should return 0 on success or a
     negative error code on failure.

 (*) void security_fs_context_free(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called to clean up anything attached to fc->security.  Note that the
     contents may have been transferred to a superblock and the pointer cleared
     during get_tree.

 (*) int security_fs_context_parse_source(struct fs_context *fc, char *src);

     Called for each source (there may be more than one if the filesystem
     supports it).  The arguments are as for the ->parse_source() method.  It
     should return 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

 (*) int security_fs_context_parse_option(struct fs_context *fc,
					  char *opt, size_t len);

     Called for each mount option.  The arguments are as for the
     ->parse_option() method.  It should return 0 to indicate that the option
     should be passed on to the filesystem, 1 to indicate that the option
     should be discarded or an error to indicate that the option should be
     rejected.

     The buffer pointed to by opt may be modified.

 (*) int security_fs_context_validate(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called after all the options have been parsed to validate the collection
     as a whole and to do any necessary allocation so that
     security_sb_get_tree() is less likely to fail.  It should return 0 or a
     negative error code.

 (*) int security_sb_get_tree(struct fs_context *fc);

     Called during the mount procedure to verify that the specified superblock
     is allowed to be mounted and to transfer the security data there.  It
     should return 0 or a negative error code.

 (*) int security_sb_mountpoint(struct fs_context *fc, struct path *mountpoint,
				unsigned int mnt_flags);

     Called during the mount procedure to verify that the root dentry attached
     to the context is permitted to be attached to the specified mountpoint.
     It should return 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.


=================================
VFS FILESYSTEM CONTEXT OPERATIONS
=================================

There are four operations for creating a filesystem context and
one for destroying a context:

 (*) struct fs_context *vfs_new_fs_context(struct file_system_type *fs_type,
					   struct dentry *reference,
					   unsigned int sb_flags,
					   enum fs_context_purpose purpose);

     Create a filesystem context for a given filesystem type and purpose.  This
     allocates the filesystem context, sets the flags, initialises the security
     and calls fs_type->init_fs_context() to initialise the filesystem private
     data.

     reference can be NULL or it may indicate the root dentry of a superblock
     that is going to be reconfigured (FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE) or the
     automount point that triggered a submount (FS_CONTEXT_FOR_SUBMOUNT).  This
     is provided as a source of namespace information.

 (*) struct fs_context *vfs_sb_reconfig(struct vfsmount *mnt,
					unsigned int sb_flags);

     Create a filesystem context from the same filesystem as an extant mount
     and initialise the mount parameters from the superblock underlying that
     mount.  This is for use by superblock parameter reconfiguration.

 (*) struct fs_context *vfs_dup_fs_context(struct fs_context *src_fc);

     Duplicate a filesystem context, copying any options noted and duplicating
     or additionally referencing any resources held therein.  This is available
     for use where a filesystem has to get a mount within a mount, such as NFS4
     does by internally mounting the root of the target server and then doing a
     private pathwalk to the target directory.

 (*) void put_fs_context(struct fs_context *fc);

     Destroy a filesystem context, releasing any resources it holds.  This
     calls the ->free() operation.  This is intended to be called by anyone who
     created a filesystem context.

     [!] filesystem contexts are not refcounted, so this causes unconditional
	 destruction.

In all the above operations, apart from the put op, the return is a mount
context pointer or a negative error code.

For the remaining operations, if an error occurs, a negative error code will be
returned.

 (*) int vfs_get_tree(struct fs_context *fc);

     Get or create the mountable root and superblock, using the parameters in
     the filesystem context to select/configure the superblock.  This invokes
     the ->validate() op and then the ->get_tree() op.

     [NOTE] ->validate() could perhaps be rolled into ->get_tree() and
     ->reconfigure().

 (*) struct vfsmount *vfs_create_mount(struct fs_context *fc);

     Create a mount given the parameters in the specified filesystem context.
     Note that this does not attach the mount to anything.

 (*) int vfs_set_fs_source(struct fs_context *fc, char *source, size_t len);

     Supply one or more source names or device names for the mount.  This may
     cause the filesystem to access the source.  Multiple sources may be
     specified if the filesystem supports it.

 (*) int vfs_parse_fs_option(struct fs_context *fc, char *key,
			     void *value, size_t v_len);

     Supply a single mount option to the filesystem context.  The mount option
     is split between its key and its value.  The option is first checked to
     see if it corresponds to a standard mount flag (in which case it is used
     to set an SB_xxx flag and consumed) or a security option (in which case
     the LSM consumes it) before it is passed on to the filesystem.

 (*) int generic_parse_monolithic(struct fs_context *fc,
				  void *data, size_t data_len);

     Parse a sys_mount() data page, assuming the form to be a text list
     consisting of key[=val] options separated by commas.  Each item in the
     list is passed to vfs_mount_option().  This is the default when the
     ->parse_monolithic() operation is NULL.
