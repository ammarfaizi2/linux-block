GPIO reset controller
=====================

A GPIO reset controller controls a number of GPIOs that are connected
to reset pins of peripheral ICs.

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "gpio-reset"
- reset-gpios: List of gpios used as reset lines. The gpio specifier for this
               property depends on the gpio controller that provides the gpio.
- #reset-cells: 1, see below

Optional properties:
- reset-delays: List of delays in microseconds. The corresponding gpio reset
                line should be asserted for this duration to reset.
- initially-in-reset: List of integers. Zero if the initial state should be
                      a deasserted reset line, nonzero if the line should be
                      kept in reset.

example:

gpio_reset: gpio-reset {
	compatible = "gpio-reset";
	reset-gpios = <&gpio5 0 1>; /* active-low */
	reset-delays = <10000>; /* 10 ms */
	initially-in-reset = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};

/* Device with nRESET pin connected to GPIO5_0 */
sii902x@39 {
	/* ... */
	resets = <&gpio_reset 0>; /* active-low GPIO5_0, 10 ms reset delay */
};
