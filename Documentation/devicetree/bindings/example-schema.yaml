  A more detailed multi-line description of the binding.

  Details about the hardware device and any links to datasheets can go here.

  Literal blocks are marked with the '|' at the beginning. The end is marked by
  indentation less than the first line of the literal block.

select: false
  # 'select' is a schema applied to a DT node to determine if this binding
  # schema should be applied to the node. It is optional and by default the
  # possible compatible strings are extracted and used to match.

properties:
  # A dictionary of DT properties for this binding schema
  compatible:
    # More complicated schema can use oneOf (XOR), anyOf (OR), or allOf (AND)
    # to handle different conditions.
    # In this case, it's needed to handle a variable number of values as there
    # isn't another way to express a constraint of the last string value.
    # The boolean schema must be a list of schemas.
