TODO list for multiqueue/new-queue. In no particular order.
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Better switching scheme for deciding when to run
  queues inline and when to punt to kblockd.

- Implement proper scheme for not having lots of processes
  or kblockds hammering on blk_mq_run_hw_queue() at the same
  time. If someone else is already running the queue, we need
  not do anything. (partially done)

- Ensure that IO ordering is more sane:
	- Let a process "stick" to a mapped queue while it
	  has IO in flight, instead of always dynamically
	  mapping it based on the current CPU.

- Add token based mq aware IO scheduler
